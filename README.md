# TDRP

This is a Gorubi solution for truck and drone routing problem in python. There are several problems and solution for randomly generated problems.

VRP_1T is a solved routing problem for single truck without any drones.

VRP_1T1D is another variant containing 1 truck and 1 drone for the same random problems. It is not solved yet and I'll update the code here as soon as I code it correctly and get the final results.
